This is a Rust project to implement a similar style unix "Uptime" feature for Windows, using Microsofts own windows-rs:

https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs

Many projects use the winapi wrappers, however there is virtually no examples using the windows-rs crate so I thought I would provide 
some because the conversions are not straightforward for a novice like me.

Any contributions and addtions are most welcome!
